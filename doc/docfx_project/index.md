# Aydsko iRacing Data API

[iRacing](https://www.iracing.com) is the leading online racing simulation for PC. During events hosted via the iRacing service there is a large amount of data created related to race results and member participation in events.

This library allows access via .NET to the iRacing "Data API". These APIs allow a properly authenticated user a supported method of accessing data from the service.

## Authentication Types

### Legacy Authentication (Username / Password)

iRacing now requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users by default. This will affect the ability to use the iRacing Data API by logging in with a username or password.

Use of the Data API will be supported by enabling "Legacy Authentication" in your iRacing account settings. iRacing will advise next steps for the authentication of applications for the Data API later on.

To use username & password authentication with this library you **must** [enable "Legacy Authentication" in your iRacing account settings](https://support.iracing.com/support/solutions/articles/31000173894-enabling-or-disabling-legacy-read-only-authentication) before attempting to authenticate. Please **do not** enable this setting unless you require it, as it may reduce the security on your iRacing account.

**âš  Note:** Legacy authentication will be removed 9 Dec 2025 and one of the OAuth-based authentication methods required. See: https://forums.iracing.com/discussion/84226/legacy-authentication-removal-dec-9-2025

### iRacing OAuth "Password Limited Grant" Authentication

The "Password Limited Grant" is authentication intended for scripts or back-end processes that do not need to access the details of specific users.

Full information is available from the [iRacing.com Auth Service "Password Limited Grant" page](https://oauth.iracing.com/oauth2/book/token_endpoint.html#password-limited-grant).

To use this authentication method you need to contact iRacing who will allocate a "Client ID" and "Client Secret".

## Getting Started

**1. Install the Aydsko iRacing Data API library.**

The library is distributed as the `Aydsko.iRacingData` NuGet package. Install using your package manager of choice.

```pwsh
dotnet add package Aydsko.iRacingData
```

**2. Register the client.**

Register the iRacing Data API client classes with the service provider.

Using legacy username/password authentication:

```csharp
services.AddIRacingDataApi(options =>
{
    options.UseProductUserAgent("MyApplicationName", new Version(1, 0));

    // Supply your iRacing username and password.
    options.UseUsernamePasswordAuthentication(iRacingUsername, iRacingPassword);
});
```

OR

Using iRacing OAuth "Password Limited Grant" authentication:

```csharp
services.AddIRacingDataApi(options =>
{
    options.UseProductUserAgent("MyApplicationName", new Version(1, 0));

    // Supply your iRacing username, password, client id, and client secret.
    options.UsePasswordLimitedOAuth(iRacingUsername, iRacingPassword, iRacingClientId, iRacingClientSecret);
});
```

**3. Use the client.**

Use the `IDataClient` from the service provider to authenticate and request data.

```csharp
// Retrieve an instance from the service provider.
var dataClient = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IDataClient>();

// Retrieve information about our own account.
var infoResponse = await dataClient.GetMyInfoAsync(cancellationToken);

// Write that information to the console.
Console.WriteLine($"Driver name: {infoResponse.Data.DisplayName}");
Console.WriteLine($"Customer ID: {infoResponse.Data.CustomerId}");
Console.WriteLine($"Club: {infoResponse.Data.ClubName}");
```

## Enable Caching of Results

**1. Add the Microsoft memory caching package.**

```powershell
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory
```

**2. Register the memory caching library with the service provider.**

```csharp
services.AddMemoryCache();
```

**3. Register the caching client.**

Register the iRacing Data API caching client classes with the service provider.

```csharp
services.AddIRacingDataApiWithCaching(options =>
{
    // [... normal configuration for your chosen authentication type here]
});
```

Then simply use the `IDataClient` as before.

# Versioning

Ideally you should always use the latest version of the library that is available. This is because iRacing will sometimes introduce API changes during a release which make the old code incompatible.

This library will use version numbers will be in the format:

    [YY][SS].[R]

Where:
 - YY = two digit year
 - SS = the iRacing season the library release was made in as a zero-padded number (i.e. 01, 02, 03, 04)
 - R  = release number, which increments when changes are made although it may not be sequential

Example:

 - 2303.1 = changes compatible with iRacing 2023 Season 3 or later, and is release 1 during this season
