At a relatively short 1.53 miles in length, its layout is deceptively simple. Even professional drivers find it difficult to unlock the secret of a very fast lap.</p> <p>Racers sometimes refer to its seven corners - six right-handers and one left - as a road racing short-track due to the high average speed and the fact that there is no opportunity to relax during a lap.</p> <p>Opened on April 20, 1957, Lime Rock Park is the home track for the Skip Barber Racing School and is one of the oldest continuously-operated road courses in North America. The track has witnessed epic battles among some true legends of the sport. Drivers like Mark Donohue, Brian Redman, Hans Stuck, Paul Newman and Geoff Brabham have all battled their way to victory at Lime Rock Park.</p> <p>In addition to SCCA club races, Lime Rock Park hosts rounds of the American Le Mans Series on the 4th of July (on a second track layout that utilizes a chicane just after the daunting Uphill corner) and the Grand Am GT series over the Memorial Day weekend. The track also is host annually to the NASCAR Camping World East Series&#8482;.</p>",

      "detail_copy": "<p>Today's \"Modified\" traces its lineage back to the very beginning of stock car racing, decades before the advent of current-body style cars made their appearance on race tracks across America. And it was at Stafford Motor Speedway 20 years ago that the Modified Stock Car, seemingly on the road to oblivion, had a rebirth.</p> <p>Racing began at the Stafford Springs Agricultural Park in 1870, but the powerplants propelling the drivers were purely equine until the end of World War II, when Midgets, Sprint Cars and on occasion Stock Cars displaced the horses on the half-mile flat dirt track.</p> <p>In 1959 the management of Stafford Speedway obtained a NASCAR sanction, an arrangement that endures to this day. Track visitors from the south - Lee Petty, Joe Weatherly and Curtis Turner challenged their northern counterparts - Pete Corey, Ernie Gahan, Bill Wimble, Frankie Schneider and a youngster named Eddie Flemke.</p> <p>In 1967 the track was paved, with flat, sweeping turns that put a premium on driving skill. Bugs Stevens, Fred Desarro, Jerry Cook, and Richie Evans all won at Stafford on their way to NASCAR National Modified Championships.</p> <p>In 1969 the Arute family took over management of the facility and in short order made changes that brought Modified racing back from its slide toward extinction. The Arutes encouraged a change in bodywork that did away with the 1930s-era coupe and sedan coachwork and put shells from contemporary cars over the tube-frame chassis. This gave the cars a more modern, up-to-date appearance, one that fans in the grandstands could better identify with. And then, a few years later, the Arutes, alarmed at the accelerating costs of racing, drew up a set of technical rules for something they called the SK Modified. The rules retained the chassis and bodywork of the standard Modified, but reduced the costs for tires and engines, the most expensive aspects of racing.</p> <p>Today, nearly 130 years after racers first competed there, Stafford Speedway is still on the cutting edge of progress. In 1997, a 270,000-watt state-of-the art MUSCO lighting system was installed. And Bose selected Stafford as a research and design facility and maintains an 8,400-watt sound system, so spectators can easily hear the announcer over the roar of the engines.</p>",

Three years later Maine businessman Bob Bahre purchased the track and began a program of improvements to the facility that included a modern large-capacity grandstand. With the widening of the backstretch during a 1992 repaving, the track assumed its current 3/8ths-mile configuration.</p> <p>During the 1960s Oxford Plains Speedway hosted NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; races, and in 1966 Bobby Allison won his first victory on NASCAR's senior circuit at OPS. Today Late Models are the featured class and the track is home to the annual TD Banknorth 250, the richest one-day Late Model race meet in America. In 2007 156 cars entered the event, with 92 of them taking part in time trials. Over the years Allison's son Davey, Jeff and Ward Burton, Kurt and Kyle Busch, Jeff Gordon, Dale Jarrett, Matt Kenseth, Bobby and Terry Labonte, Mark Martin, and Rusty Wallace are among the NASCAR stars who have competed in this historic Late-Model event.</p>",

      "detail_copy": "<p>Located outside the picturesque village of Elkhart Lake, in Wisconsin's beautiful Kettle Moraine region, an hour north of Milwaukee and just two hours from Chicago, Road America opened in 1955. From 1950 through 1953 the town had been host to annual sports car races conducted on ad-hoc circuits made up of linked sections of county highways, but safety concerns ended open-road racing. The track was built by local civil engineer Cliff Tufte, who set out a 14-turn, four-mile ribbon of pavement, literally over hill and dale. Tufte took advantage of the hillsides adjacent to many parts of the track to provide natural viewing areas for spectators.</p> <p>Road America, one of the world's classic road-racing venues, has been host to every important North American racing series, beginning with SCCA sports cars in the 1950s, to the Can-Am and Trans-Am in the '60s and '70s, IMSA's GT and GTP cars since the '70s, and Indy cars beginning in 1982. NASCAR even ran a race at Road America, back in 1956, won by the legendary Tim Flock. The June Sprints, put on annually for more than 50 years by the SCCA's Chicago Region, draws 600  amateur sports car racers and as many as 30,000 spectators. The current schedule also includes vintage and motorcycle racing.</p> <p>One of the unique aspects of Road America is that it is beloved both by spectators, who are afforded a variety of spectacular views and by drivers, who value the challenges the track presents. And while Road America enjoys a rich tradition, it is not a prisoner of its history. A recent upgrade to the facility saw spectator viewing and paddock access improved by the replacement of the Bill Mitchell bridge with a tunnel a hundred yards further down the road. A further nod to the performance gains wrought by modern technology is the addition of an optional chicane at Road America's famous \"kink\" in the back straightaway, providing a second configuration for race series that don't wish to expose their drivers to one of motorsport's biggest thrills every four miles.</p>",

While Ascot was a gritty dirt track that harkened back to the oldest traditions of short-track racing, Irwindale is clean, modern and filled with amenities for drivers, crews, fans and sponsors.</p> <p>The facility features banked, paved half-mile and third- mile oval tracks, and a state-of-the-art MUSCO lighting system that makes racing at night just like racing during the day. A Bose sound system ensures that everyone in the 15,000-seat grandstand can hear the announcer over the roar of the racing engines.</p> <p>NASCAR Late Model Stock Car Series&#8482; and Legends Cars are among the large number of classes that compete regularly at Irwindale. (Others include , USAC Midgets and Sprint Cars, Supermodifieds, Super Late Models, Trucks, Mini Stocks. To say nothing of drawing big crowds for drifting events and serving as the site for the world-record setting run by a radio-control car - 111 mph!)</p> <p>While Angelenos call it their home-town short track, Irwindale draws national attention for two of its annual special events. As the inheritor of short-track racing tradition in Southern California, Irwindale hosts the legendary Turkey Night Grand Prix, a series of Thanksgiving weekend races for Midgets and Sprint Cars that goes back to the 1950s. And since 2003, the half-mile mile oval has hosted the NASCAR Toyota All-Star Showdown&#8482;.</p>",

Oh, and then there's the addition of grandstands to increase the seating capacity from the original total of 750 to the 85,000 it boasts today.</p> <p>Now owned by International Speedway Corporation, Martinsville Speedway hosts the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482;, NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series&#8482;, NASCAR Late Model Stock Car Series&#8482; and the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour&#8482;.

      "detail_copy": "<p>Located outside the picturesque village of Elkhart Lake, in Wisconsin's beautiful Kettle Moraine region, an hour north of Milwaukee and just two hours from Chicago, Road America opened in 1955. From 1950 through 1953 the town had been host to annual sports car races conducted on ad-hoc circuits made up of linked sections of county highways, but safety concerns ended open-road racing. The track was built by local civil engineer Cliff Tufte, who set out a 14-turn, four-mile ribbon of pavement, literally over hill and dale. Tufte took advantage of the hillsides adjacent to many parts of the track to provide natural viewing areas for spectators.</p> <p>Road America, one of the world's classic road-racing venues, has been host to every important North American racing series, beginning with SCCA sports cars in the 1950s, to the Can-Am and Trans-Am in the '60s and '70s, IMSA's GT and GTP cars since the '70s, and Indy cars beginning in 1982. NASCAR even ran a race at Road America, back in 1956, won by the legendary Tim Flock. The June Sprints, put on annually for more than 50 years by the SCCA's Chicago Region, draws 600  amateur sports car racers and as many as 30,000 spectators. The current schedule also includes vintage and motorcycle racing.</p> <p>One of the unique aspects of Road America is that it is beloved both by spectators, who are afforded a variety of spectacular views and by drivers, who value the challenges the track presents. And while Road America enjoys a rich tradition, it is not a prisoner of its history. A recent upgrade to the facility saw spectator viewing and paddock access improved by the replacement of the Bill Mitchell bridge with a tunnel a hundred yards further down the road. A further nod to the performance gains wrought by modern technology is the addition of an optional chicane at Road America's famous \"kink\" in the back straightaway, providing a second configuration for race series that don't wish to expose their drivers to one of motorsport's biggest thrills every four miles.</p>",

Sonoma Raceway presents a unique challenge for drivers of big stock cars. While the 1.99-mile, 10-turn stock car configuration cuts off two slow turns and a half mile of pavement, there are still plenty of ups and downs and zigs and zags for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; and NASCAR Camping World West Series&#8482; drivers to cope with. Keeping the tires and brakes in good working order while maintaining a competitive pace is one of the bigger challenges these drivers face all year.</p> <p>Most other road-racing classes that compete at Sonoma, including the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series&#8482;, SCCA National and Regional, NASA and vintage use the full 2.52-mile, 12-turn circuit, while the IRL Indy cars and AMA motorcycle events use a modified 2.22 mile (3.57 km), 12 turn course. This layout, opened in 2003, skips much of the Esses and run from Turn 10 to Turn 11 (the hairpin) for additional safety for motorcyclists, including runoff available in the motorcycle Turn 11 (the main Turn 11 has no runoff, and is a very slow turn, similar to the Loews hairpin at Monaco).</p> <p>Until it was taken over by Speedway Motorsports in 1996, the facility endured a turbulent history under a variety or names and owners (one of which was a Hollywood studio!) While the circuit opened for competition in 1968 under the name Sears Point Raceway and hosted , USAC Indy car, NASCAR West stock car, SCCA professional and amateur and AMA motorcycle races, it failed to perform financially and was closed down two years later. In 1973 the track reopened as a venue for amateur sports car competition and - on a separate drag strip - drag racing, but it wasn't until 1989 and the arrival of NASCAR's top series that the track's prospects truly began to brighten. A $60 million improvement program, begun in 2000, has catapulted Sonoma Raceway into the top rank of American motorsport facilities.</p>",

The secret is in the variable banking in the 300-yard wide-open corners - you may not have much room to accelerate off one corner before shutting down for the next, but with steep banking (up to 30 degrees) there's not much loss of speed when you get there. And the all-concrete racing surface provides great traction.</p><p>\nWith 160,000 seats, arrayed in grandstands all the way around the racing surface, Bristol looks more like a football stadium on steroids than a typical race track. Veteran drivers have described racing at this East Tennessee speed emporium as the equivalent of \"flying a fighter plane in a gymnasium,\" so it's not surprising that every NASCAR Cup Series race draws a massive crowd. Still, the best seat in the house is the one behind the wheel. But it's sure not a relaxing one, with laps at racing speeds ticking by at barely more than 15 seconds. Oh, and the compact nature of the track means that there are infield pits on both the front and rear straightaways, so drivers have that added complication to deal with. At the conclusion of a 500-lap NASCAR Cup Series race, not a single car makes it back to the garage without at least a few bumps, scrapes or other battle bruises. And the drivers aren't in much better shape.</p><p>\nOpened for competition in 1961, Bristol Motor Speedway has had a number of remodels over the years, and several owners as well. It has been under its current owner, Speedway Motorsports, that Bristol Motor Speedway has enjoyed its greatest period of growth.

      "detail_copy": "<p>Nestled in the Sonoma Mountains near a geographic formation known as Sears Point, Sonoma Raceway is one of only two road-racing venues on the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; schedule. Sonoma Raceway presents a unique challenge for drivers of big stock cars. While the 1.99-mile, 10-turn stock car configuration cuts off two slow turns and a half mile of pavement, there are still plenty of ups and downs and zigs and zags for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; and NASCAR Camping World West Series&#8482; drivers to cope with. Keeping the tires and brakes in good working order while maintaining a competitive pace is one of the bigger challenges these drivers face all year.</p> <p>Most other road-racing classes that compete at Sonoma, including the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series&#8482;, SCCA National and Regional, NASA and vintage use the full 2.52-mile, 12-turn circuit, while the IRL Indy cars and AMA motorcycle events use a modified 2.22 mile (3.57 km), 12 turn course. This layout, opened in 2003, skips much of the Esses and run from Turn 10 to Turn 11 (the hairpin) for additional safety for motorcyclists, including runoff available in the motorcycle Turn 11 (the main Turn 11 has no runoff, and is a very slow turn, similar to the Loews hairpin at Monaco).</p> <p>Until it was taken over by Speedway Motorsports in 1996, the facility endured a turbulent history under a variety or names and owners (one of which was a Hollywood studio!) While the circuit opened for competition in 1968 under the name Sears Point Raceway and hosted , USAC Indy car, NASCAR West stock car, SCCA professional and amateur and AMA motorcycle races, it failed to perform financially and was closed down two years later. In 1973 the track reopened as a venue for amateur sports car competition and - on a separate drag strip - drag racing, but it wasn't until 1989 and the arrival of NASCAR's top series that the track's prospects truly began to brighten. A $60 million improvement program, begun in 2000, has catapulted Sonoma Raceway into the top rank of American motorsport facilities.</p>",

      "detail_copy": "<p>\"The Lady in Black,\" \"The Track That's Too Tough To Tame\"; those are two of the names, the polite ones anyway, that drivers and fans have given Darlington Raceway over the years. The oldest speedway on the NASCAR circuit, Darlington Raceway's egg-shaped configuration - one end is big and wide-open while the other is pinched tight - has been perplexing racing drivers and mechanics since it opened in 1950 with the inaugural running of the Southern 500 NASCAR stock car race. The track was built on an old farm in the middle of rural South Carolina, and its unique shape is the legacy of a minnow pond that the farmer who owned the land wasn't willing to give up. Minnows still swim in that pond six decades later, and while lap speeds have risen to nearly 180 mph, a car set up just right for one end of the 1.366-mile oval still won't handle on the other one. The fastest lap times are achieved with a compromise - the car isn't perfect at either end of the track, but a really talented driver can coax the car quickly enough through both sets of corners.</p> <p>A look at the list of race winners over the years confirms that at Darlington talent tells. Few journeymen drivers have won at Darlington - through the years the winner's circle has mostly welcomed the sport's enduring stars. Those legendary drivers have dominated the competition, and at a track where it is so difficult to win even once, those who have unlocked Darlington's mysteries have been able to win again and again; of the 43 men who have won a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; race there through 2008, more than half - 24 to be exact - have won at least twice. Richard Petty and Buck Baker have the three victories each to their credit; Bill Elliott and Harry Gant were four-time winners; Bobby Allison, Darrell Waltrip and Cale Yarborough have won five times; and in recent years, as the competition in NASCAR intensified, Jeff Gordon has found his way first under the checkered flag a remarkable seven times.</p> <p>When it comes to the true Darlington legends, however, two drivers stand apart from the rest. Dale Earnhardt, Sr. won nine times. \"You never forget your first love,\" Earnhardt was quoted as saying. \"Whether it's a high school sweetheart, a faithful old hunting dog, or a fickle race track in South Carolina with a contrary disposition. And, if you happen to be a race car driver there's no victory so sweet, so memorable, as whipping Darlington Raceway.\"</p> <p>But the most successful driver of all time at what is perhaps the most difficult track on the NASCAR circuit is David Pearson, the '60s and '70s ace known as the Silver Fox for his smooth style behind the wheel. Ten times at Darlington Pearson outfoxed the other drivers and the track itself. If he'd won any more, they'd have had to turn over the deed to the track to him.</p>",

      "detail_copy": "<p>Talladega Superspeedway lives up to its name - of all the closed-circuit motorsports facilities in the world where sanctioned auto races are held, it is the fastest. Constructed by the France family's International Speedway Corporation ten years after Daytona International Speedway, Talladega was built slightly longer at 2.66 miles and with steeper 33-degree banking which guaranteed record-setting speeds. The pole speed for NASCAR's first race in 1969 was a stunning 199.466 mph, almost 30 mph faster than the IndyCars were then lapping at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.</p> <p>In 1975 Mark Donohue set the world record for speed on a closed course by driving a Porsche 917-30 around Talladega Superspeedway at 221.160 mph. Donohue's world record stood for four years before finally being broken at Italy's 7.5-mile Nardo high-speed test facility.</p> <p>Rule changes in 1987 mean Bill Elliott's 212.809 mph lap will stand forever as the qualifying record at Talladega and for NASCAR. Talladega Superspeedway is still the fastest track on the schedule - it holds the record for the fastest 500-mile stock car race at 188.354 mph; Mark Martin's winning speed in May, 1997 - and produces some of the most exciting fender-to-fender racing every year.</p> <p>Talladega holds the record for most leaders in a 500-mile race (26) and most lead changes as well (75 at the start/finish line), but on the last lap, don't ever bet against a driver named Earnhardt. Dale Sr. racked up an amazing ten NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; race wins, and Dale Jr. already has five on his resume, including a remarkable four-in-a-row streak in 2002-3.</p> <p>Talladega Superspeedway presents five separate racing shows each year as host to the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482;, the NASCAR Nationwide Series&#8482;, the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series&#8482; and the Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA). Competing in high-speed packs at Talladega should prove both challenging and exciting for iRacers as well.</p>",

      "detail_copy": "<p>With the possible exception of New York City, no American market has been more coveted - or more underserved - by the auto racing industry than Chicago. After the Meadowdale International Raceway road course and its fiercesome \"Monza Wall\" closed in 1968, sanctioning bodies from CART and IMSA to Formula One attempted to organize auto races in, around and through the Windy City with little success. Even Chip Ganassi's Midas touch failed when his Chicago Motor Speedway ceased operations in 2002 after just four years of staging CART and NASCAR races.</p> <p>Of course, one major factor contributing to the demise of CMS was the opening of a competing facility in nearby Joliet by the name of Chicagoland Speedway. Built at a cost of $130 million and backed by a virtual Who's Who of American auto racing, Chicagoland Speedway is a world class motor sports complex featuring a 1.5 mile superspeedway together with a state-of-the-art drag strip at the adjacent Route 66 Raceway. Who's Who? Try Tony George and the late Bill France, Jr., together with a collection of Chicago-area entrepreneurs including IndyCar Series team owner Dale Coyne.</p> <p>Although it's tempting to lump the 1.5 mile oval with the bevy of so-called \"intermediate\" ovals that rose across the country in the 1990s and early years of the 21st century, Chicagoland's layout is unique. It's an oval that never truly straightens out thanks to a couple of kinks on the frontstretch and a backstretch that is one long, continuous curve. As a result, Chicagoland poses unique challenges, not just to those who drive it but to the engineers and mechanics who must fine-tune their cars to the track's singular character.</p> <p>Since opening for business in 2001, Chicagoland has established a rich history in its first decade of operation, particularly in IndyCar competition. In a series renowned for its photo finishes, the IndyCar Series has produced the two closest finishes in series history at Chicagoland, with Sam Hornish, Jr. beating Al Unser, Jr. by .0024s in 2002 and Helio Castroneves pipping Scott Dixon by .033s in the 2008 season finale. Of course, neither Dario Franchitti nor Scott Dixon will soon forget the 2007 contest that saw the Scotsman win the race - and the IndyCar Series title - when \"Dixie\" ran out of fuel half a lap from the finish.</p> <p>Chicagoland is no less competitive when the race cars sport fenders. In fact, Kyle Busch is the only driver to win a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; race at Chicagoland from the pole and only one other driver - Kevin Harvick - has qualified in the top ten and won. Harvick also has the distinction of coming from the deepest in the field (32nd) to win at Chicagoland, while Dale Earnhardt, Jr. (25th) and Tony Stewart (19th) also emerged victorious after starting deep in the pack.</p>",

      "detail_copy": "<p>Designed by Charles Moneypenny, the same architect who created Daytona International speedway, and located in the vacation-area Irish Hills of the south-central part of the state, Michigan International Speedway is best-known for the awesome speeds and competitive racing spawned by its broad racing surface and 73-foot-wide, 18-degree banked turns.  Michigan's width and steep banking ensure there's always more than one racing groove, and the fact that MIS is a non-restrictor-plate track means drivers have more than enough power to make a challenge out of the turns at both ends of the track.</p> <p>Once upon a time Indy cars frolicked on those high banks at breathtaking speeds, witness Paul Tracy's record qualifying lap of 234.949 mph.   Today, Michigan regularly vies with Daytona, Talladega and Texas as NASCAR's fastest speedway, with Ryan Newman holding the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; track record of 194.232 mph.   While MIS' Stirling Moss-designed 3.1-mile road course and the Can-Am and Trans-Am races of days gone-by are now just fond memories, the track has a 1.9-mile interior road course that has challenged IMSA and amateur racers down through the years.</p> <p>It's no wonder some of stock car racing's most legendary drivers have thrived on the banks of MIS since Cale Yarborough defeated Lee Roy Yarbrough in the inaugural NASCAR race there in 1969.  Richard Petty and David Pearson, Bobby and Davey Allison, Dale Earnhardt Senior and Junior, Jeff Gordon and Jimmie Johnson have all since added their names to the roll call of MIS winners, one that also includes names like Mario Andretti, A.J. Foyt, Al Unser, Rick Mears and Alex Zanardi from the days when Indy cars raced in the Irish Hills, not to mention Parnelli Jones and Mark Donohue, Trans-Am winners on the MIS road course that, once upon a time, snaked through the countryside behind the backstretch.  Allison to Yarborough, Andretti to Zanardi, the world's greatest race drivers have been coming to Michigan International Speedway to test their mettle for more than 40 years.  And the fans have followed by the hundreds of thousands.\nDetroit-area real-estate developer Larry LoPatin had the vision to build first Michigan International Speedway and then a Southwestern duplicate, Texas World Speedway in College Station, TX.  But LoPatin's reach exceeded his grasp and it was a fellow named Roger Penske who stepped in and turned MIS into an auto-racing showcase.  Under Penske's direction, MIS grew from a rather modest seating capacity of 25,000 to more than 125,000 between 1972 and '99.  And the first order of business when the International Speedway Corporation acquired the facility from Penske?  Add another 10,000 seats in Turn Three, enhancing MIS' status as the largest sports facility in the Wolverine State.</p>",

      "detail_copy": "<p>Called the Tricky Triangle by some, the Bermuda Triangle by others, three-cornered Pocono Raceway is utterly unique. Situated in the Pocono Mountains of northeastern Pennsylvania , the 2.5 mile tri-oval features three very different turns connected by straightaways of varying length. Turn One is banked at 14 degrees, Turn Two (aka the \"Tunnel Turn\") is banked at eight degrees and Turn Three at six degrees. Pocono's main straightaway is the longest on any North American speedway at 3,740 feet, the \"Long Pond\" straightaway stretches for 3,055 feet between Turns One and Two, while the run from Turn Two to Turn Three is a mere 1,780 feet.</p> <p>The resulting speedway poses special demands on drivers and engineer alike, for a chassis that works well on the steeply-banked Turn One will be less than ideal for the flatter Turn Two, let alone Turn Three, and the downforce necessary for maximum grip in any of the turns will slow a car on the two long straightaways. And Turn Three requires heavy braking - in some cases even a gearchange - making Pocono Raceway among the world's most challenging speedways.</p> <p>Pocono Raceway first opened for business in 1969 featuring a three quarter mile oval. The 2.5 mile speedway was completed in 1971 and immediately began hosting one of the jewels in Indy car racing triple crown of 500 mile races. Local hero Mario Andretti battled the likes of A.J. Foyt, Al and Bobby Unser, Johnny Rutherford and Gordon Johncock in , USAC-sanctioned Indy car races.

Born in 1957 during the initial blitz of U.S. road-racing circuit development, VIR was one of the major sports car racing facilities during the 1960s. Cobra legend Carroll Shelby won the inaugural race behind the wheel of a Maserati 450 S, and over the years races at VIR produced fields populated by sports car stars Carl Haas, Bob Holbert, Augie Pabst, Bob Grossman, Don Yenko, Dick Thompson, Walt Hansgen and Bruce Jennings and NASCAR legends such as Richard Petty, David Pearson, Curtis Turner and Wendell Scott (the latter hailing from nearby Danville, Va.)</p> <p>The track hosted SCCA Trans Am and IMSA endurance races (the first two of which were won by Porsche teammates Peter Gregg and Hurley Haywood), but with its remote location, far from the population centers that fill the spectator areas, VIR experienced financial problems and closed in 1974. Suddenly silent, the facility reverted to farm land.</p> <p>The 1,200-acre parcel still would be farmland today had New York real-estate developer and vintage racer Harvey Siegel not purchased it in 1998 and undertaken the herculean task of not only restoring the circuit, but bringing it up to world-class standards. While retaining the backbone of the original circuit, including its trademark Oak Tree turn, Siegel widened the track to 40 feet and gave it modern safety and convenience features. Today, VIRginia International Raceway (as it now bills itself) offers six configurations (Full Course - 3.27 miles; North Course - 2.25 miles; South Course - 1.65 miles; Patriot Course - 1.1 miles; Grand West - 3.97 Miles; and Grand East - 4.07 miles) of which 2 can always be run simultaneously.</p> <p>All of the courses are challenging, but the 3.27-mile Full Course, the track's original configuration, is a true classic. Straightaways of 3,000 and 4,000 feet yield terrific velocities for any race car, while a 130-foot elevation change adds more dimension to a driver's lap.</p> <p>And while the modern iteration of this classic road-racing facility focuses on amateur events, in addition to NASA amateur sports car events, SCCA national and regional club races, SVRA and HSR vintage competition, VIR hosts AMA motorcycle racing, Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series&#8482; and the Grand-Am KONI Challenge Series&#8482;. Today, with the tremendous population growth in Raleigh and Greensboro, just an hour's drive from the track, professional racing at VIR draws more than respectable crowds.</p>",

Summit Point opened in 1973 and while early in its history the track hosted professional road-racing series, in recent years the focus for the entire facility has been on amateur racing, high-performance driver training and club events.</p> <p>The Summit Point circuit, in either it's long or short configuration, is quite fast and features a 40-foot elevation change. The 2,900-foot pit straight is preceded by a fast right-hander, so speeds are high at the braking point for the acute corner at the end of the straight. Miss your braking point and you'll have a fast trip through tall grass. The fast downhill approach to the tight Wagon Wheel also requires careful and precise braking on the approach and careful throttle modulation all the way around the long corner.</p> <p>The Jefferson Circuit is a great learning tool, with seven turns - lefts, rights, switchbacks and elevation changes - crammed into barely more than a mile of pavement.</p>",

Designed and built in the late 1950s on the rolling, wooded sandhill country about 50 miles east of Toronto, Canadian Tire Motorsport Park's ten-turn, 2.459 mile track is widely-regarded as one of the most daunting road courses on the planet owing to an abundance of ultra-fast, blind corners, many of which feature dramatic elevation changes. However, the track's signature turn is Moss Corner, a double apex hairpin named in honor of Stirling Moss, who re-designed the corner after seeing its originally-planned configuration.</p> <p>Fittingly, Moss won the first major race held at Mosport (pronounced Moe-Sport as a contraction of the words \"motor\" and \"sport\") in a Lotus 19 in 1961. Canadian Tire Motorsport Park subsequently enjoyed tremendous popularity throughout the 1960s and became the traditional first round of the Can-Am Challenge Series. In 1967 Canadian Tire Motorsport Park staged the first true World Championship Canadian Grand Prix Formula One event, won by Jack Brabham. Together with Quebec's Circuit Mont Tremblant, Canadian Tire Motorsport Park hosted the Canadian Grand Prix on alternate years and, later, served as the event's permanent home from 1972 until the race moved to Montreal's Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in 1978.</p> <p>In addition to Formula One, Canadian Tire Motorsport Park also staged a couple of , USAC Indy car races in the late '60s and, after losing the Canadian Grand Prix to Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, continued to host major motorcycle and sports car races including the IMSA Camel GT and, more recently, American Le Mans Series.</p> <p>Originally a publically-owned venture, Canadian Tire Motorsport Park saw a succession of owners including Norm Namerow and Harvey Huddes before the Panoz Motor Sports Group acquired the facility in 1998. The PMSG widened and repaved the track in 2001 in order to meet FIA specifications although, in contrast to the vast majority of road courses built in the 1950s and '60s still being utilized, Canadian Tire Motorsport Park's basic layout (and character) remains intact.</p> <p>In 1967, Jimmy Clark in his Lotus 49 Ford/Cosworth won the pole for the inaugural Canadian Grand Prix with a lap of 1:22.4. The current track record of 1:04.094 (138.116 mph) was established by Dindo Capello in an Audi R10 TDI in 2008.</p> <p>In addition to the 2.459 mile Grand Prix circuit, Canadian Tire Motorsport Park includes a half-mile paved oval; a 2.4 km advanced driver and race driver training facility with a quarter-mile skid pad (Canadian Tire Motorsport Park Driver Development Centre) and a 1.4 km kart track (Canadian Tire Motorsport Park International Karting).</p>",

Coupled with the heavy braking at the end of the straightaway, the modest banking encouraged overtaking maneuvers, the most famous of which resulted in Mario Andretti and James Hunt banging wheels during the 1977 Dutch Grand Prix.</p> <p>Over the years, Zandvoort witnessed many classic races. In 1959 Jo Bonnier scored B.R.M's first Formula One victory there. Eight years later the legendary Ford Cosworth DFV earned a famous win in its competition debut in the hands of Jimmy Clark, one of four Dutch Grand Prix wins for the Scotsman. The rain-swept '71 Dutch Grand Prix featured a showdown between the two great rainmeisters of the day - Jacky Ickx and Pedro Rodriguez - that was ultimately resolved in the Belgian's favor. A partial list of Ickx' fellow Dutch GP winners includes Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jack Brabham, Jimmy Clark, James Hunt, Alan Prost and Niki Lauda.</p> <p>Following the 1985 Dutch Grand Prix the circuit closed owing to financial problems. It reopened four years later as Circuit Park Zandvoort and featured an abbreviated (1.6 mile) version of the original track for use in club racing. In 1995, however, the Dutch government gave the CPZ the go-ahead to develop a new international level circuit. The resulting facility opened in 2001, featuring a modern pit complex as well as the old Tarzanbocht and the new Arie Luyendyk-bocht, which honors the two-time Indianapolis 500 winner who cut his racing teeth at Zandvoort.</p> <p>The contemporary Club Circuit Zandvoort boasts five different configurations including the Grand Prix, Chicane, Club, National and Oostelijk circuits ranging in length from 2.67 to .87 miles. In addition to a full slate of amateur and club races, Club Circuit Zandvoort annually hosts a round of the German Touring Car Championship as well as the Masters of F3, featuring many of the world's top young drivers.</p>",

      "detail_copy": "<p>Australia's premier permanent road course, Phillip Island is a 2.7-mile (4.4 km) thrill ride of a race track situated on an island just off the southern coast near Melbourne. The 12-turn circuit features a long main straightaway, hair-raisingly fast turns, tight hairpins and dramatic elevation changes, including a precipitous drop from Lukey Heights to the tight Turn Ten. Set against the deep blue backdrop of the Bass Strait separating the Australian mainland from Tasmania, Phillip Island is among the world's spectacular motorsports venues.</p> <p>Phillip Island has a rich motorsports history dating back to the early twentieth century when the 10 Miles Road Race (since known as the inaugural Australian Grand Prix) was staged over one of the world's first \"ro-vals\" -- a rectangle of public roads with four identical corners. As speeds increased a new Phillip Island circuit was developed around an existing airfield and operated into the mid-1930s. In the aftermath of World War II, a new, permanent track was built on the edge of the island's south coast and hosted its first race in 1956. The facility experienced good times and bad, in part due to the track maintenance required by its roller-coaster character. The Phillip Island circuit closed its doors from 1962-66 and again from the late 1970s until it reopened in 1989 as the site of the Australian round of the World Motorcycle Championship.</p> <p>Phillip Island has since come to be regarded as one of the world's most challenging race tracks - be it on two or four wheels. The facility hosts world class auto and motorcycle racing each year including the Australian V8 Supercar Championship as well as the Australian MotoGP and a round of the World Superbike Championship.</p>",

Summit Point opened in 1973 and while early in its history the track hosted professional road-racing series, in recent years the focus for the entire facility has been on amateur racing, high-performance driver training and club events.</p> <p>The Summit Point circuit, in either it's long or short configuration, is quite fast and features a 40-foot elevation change. The 2,900-foot pit straight is preceded by a fast right-hander, so speeds are high at the braking point for the acute corner at the end of the straight. Miss your braking point and you'll have a fast trip through tall grass. The fast downhill approach to the tight Wagon Wheel also requires careful and precise braking on the approach and careful throttle modulation all the way around the long corner.</p> <p>The Jefferson Circuit is a great learning tool, with seven turns - lefts, rights, switchbacks and elevation changes - crammed into barely more than a mile of pavement.</p>",

The track has witnessed epic battles among some true legends of the sport.

      "detail_copy": "<p>The terms \"Thompson Speedway\" and \"New England motorsports\" are all but synonymous. The track that became known as the \"Indy of the East\" was born of the calamitous hurricane (\"The Long Island Express\") that devastated much of New England in 1938, including the Connecticut farm of John Hoening. Rather than rebuilding his farm, Hoening constructed the country's first paved race track on the site - a 5/8s mile oval with turns banked at 26 degrees.</p> <p>Hoening opened his Thompson International Speedway on May 26, 1940 for a race featuring what are now called sprint cars. Dizzy Vance won the track's debut event for car owner Louis D'Amore before an overflow crowd... and motor racing fans have been flocking to the northeast corner of Connecticut ever since.</p> <p>Following World War II, Thompson became a hotbed of stock car racing. In 1951, the newly-organized National Association for Stock Car Automobile Racing (aka NASCAR) staged a Grand National race at Thompson won by Neil Cole. While the Grand National series (now NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482;) would return on a number of occasions with NASCAR legends like David Pearson and Bobby Issac visiting victory lane, Thompson's weekly racing series would be the springboard for many of stock racing's biggest stars. Daytona 500 winner Pete Hamilton, Talladega 500 winner Ron Bouchard, Pete Sacks, Jimmy Spencer and Geoffrey, Brett and Todd Bodine all cut their teeth at Thompson which has since added a º mile oval to the facility, complimenting the legendary 5/8 mile track.</p> <p>Today, seventy years on from its tumultuous birth, Thompson International Speedway remains in the capable hands of Hoening's son Donald, together with grandson D.R. Theirs continues to be one of the busiest race tracks in the country, running weekly stock car races for Sunoco Modifieds, Super Late Models, Late Models, Thompson Modifieds, Limited Sportsman, Mini-Stocks, Pro Four Modifieds as well as the NASCAR Whelen Modified Series&#8482;.</p>",

And it's not just because there's a 46 foot tall, muscle-bound, statue outside the gates named \"Miles the Monster.\" <p>No, Dover International Speedway is a real monster of a race track. Exactly one mile in length, Dover has some of the most extreme banking (24 degrees) on the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; circuit. Even the straights are banked at nine degrees. Did we mention Dover is one of only two Sprint Cup tracks (along with Bristol Motor Speedway) that features concrete pavement the whole way 'round? <p>Dover is also unique in that the track is part of a larger sports and entertainment complex that includes a hotel, gaming casino and harness racing track. But it's the mechanical ponies - as in the 750  horsepower NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; machines and their sibling NASCAR Nationwide Series&#8482; and NASCAR Camping World Truck Series&#8482; racers - that grab the motorsports fans' attention twice a year. Up to 140,000 people from the Mid-Atlantic and beyond flock to the track for two big NASCAR weekends in the Spring and Fall. <p>Constructed between 1967 and '69, Dover International Speedway was initially paved with asphalt. It wasn't until 1995's comprehensive revamp that the track was paved in concrete, giving Dover's racing surface its distinctive white appearance - albeit with many of shades of gray and black after a weekend's worth of rubber is laid down! No matter the pavement, Dover has long been one of the most competitive tracks on the NASCAR schedule. From 1969 through '80, 21 of the 22 Cup races at Dover International Speedway were won by drivers who either already had or would go on to win championships in NASCAR's top series. <p>The names of those winners are part of the fabric of the sport - Richard Petty, Bobby Allison, David Pearson, Cale Yarborough, Benny Parsons and Darrell Waltrip. Allison and Petty rank first on the all-time winner's list at Dover International Speedway with seven victories apiece. More recently, Jimmie Johnson (six), Jeff Gordon (four), Mark Martin (four) and a host of other stock car legends have added their names to the list of Dover International Speedway's winners, a list that also includes Scott Sharp and Greg Ray, who each won a race during Dover's cameo appearance on the Indy Racing League calendar in the late 1990s.",

      "detail_copy": "<p>The first motorsports competition at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway took place in 1909 in form of motorcycle races and automobile races soon followed. When the track's original surface of crushed stone and tar proved problematic, the owners paved the track with more than 3 million bricks, giving rise to its nickname: \"The Brickyard.\"</p> <p>It wasn't until Memorial Day of 1911, however, that the first 500 mile race was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and won by Ray Harroun in his Marmon Wasp. What quickly became known as the Indianapolis 500 became one of the nation's leading sports events in the 1920s and '30s. To win the \"Indy 500\" was to achieve instant notoriety, and the names of early winners like Tommy Milton, Louis Meyer and Wilbur Shaw are indelibly etched in the annals of American motorsports.</p> <p>A nationwide ban on motorsports during World War II, however, nearly spelled the end for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which lay in virtual ruin when a consortium headed by Indiana businessman Tony Hulman purchased the facility in 1945. Hulman and his partners invested heavily in the facility and expanded the spectator capacity to the point that the Indianapolis Motor Speedway became the world's largest sporting arena (in terms of permanent seats) and the Indy 500 the world's largest single-day sports event with crowds regularly topping 350,000. The march of progress also included the gradual process of paving-over the bricks with a modern asphalt surface. By 1961 the resurfacing had been completed – leaving just the famous \"yard of bricks\" at the start/finish line as a tribute to the tradition of \"The Brickyard.”</p> <p>The 1990s saw major changes to the Speedway. In 1994, IMS president Tony George (grandson of Tony Hulman) consummated an agreement with NASCAR to stage a stock car race - the Brickyard 400 - at the Speedway. Then in 2000, George brought Formula One racing back to the , USA after a nine-year absence, staging the U.S. Grand Prix at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.</p> <p>To do so, however, required a massive renovation of the facility, including the construction of a 2.605-mile road course that combined a portion of the oval with a twisting infield section. Although the F1 race would only last through 2007, its place was been taken by Moto GP, enabling the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to return to its motorcycle roots. Beginning in 2014, the road course will also host the Grand Prix of Indianapolis IndyCar race as the kick-off to a month of May concluding with the Indianapolis 500 on its traditional Memorial Day weekend date. </p>",

The following year, Clay Regazzoni captured the inaugural U.S. Grand Prix (West) and in 1977 Mario Andretti passed Jody Scheckter in the closing laps to become the first American to win an F1 race on home ground.\nAndretti's popular victory put the race on firm financial footing and set in motion the rebirth of Long Beach, which morphed from a down-on-its heels port city to a thriving modern city/tourist destination. The resulting building boom necessitated ongoing changes to the track layout, finally settling on the current 1.968 mile, 11 turn circuit encircling the Long Beach Convention Center and the Long Beach Aquarium.</p>\n<p>Nor were the changes limited to the track and its environs. The Long Beach GP changed gears in 1984, bringing the home-grown Indy cars to town as the featured attraction. The event hardly missed a beat, as the names of Unser, Zanardi, Montoya, Franchitti and Power soon joined the likes of Regazzoni, Andretti, Villeneuve, Piquet and Lauda on the illustrious list of Long Beach winners. What's more, the event grew to include - at various times - the American Le Mans Series, GRAND-AM Sports Car Series and the Pirelli World Challenge, along with the popular Toyota Celebrity race in which Hollywood's famous (and near famous) exchange Armani and Gucci for Simpson and Bell.</p>\n<p>F1 or IndyCar, world class driver or movie star, the Long Beach Grand Prix circuit is as testing as they come ... with very hard walls eagerly awaiting the slightest mistake.</p>",

Immediately adjacent to NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA, the relatively flat, .395 mile asphalt oval has been the launching pad for many NASCAR careers including those of Denny Hamlin and Elliott Sadler, and was the site of nine NASCAR Grand National races won by the likes of Ned Jarrett, Bobby Isaac, Bobby Allison, David Pearson and, of course, Richard Petty.</p> <p>Langley's heritage dates to the 1940s when the property was the site of an 8/10 mile dirt horse race track known as the Dude Ranch. The track owners occasionally promoted auto races at the track and, by the 1950s, realized the auto races attracted bigger crowds than the horse races. They shortened the track to its current length and eventually sold the facility to Harry Kilch in 1963. Kilch immediately set about making improvements to the rough and tumble track and hosted NASCAR Grand National Series events between 1964 and 1970. Langley was paved in 1968 and, two years later, hosted the final Grand National race before the series was renamed the Winston Cup.</p> <p>Today, under the ownership of former racer/area businessman Bill Mullis, Langley Speedway hosts a variety of NASCAR-sanctioned sanctioned series including the Whelen All-American Series. The track currently hosts 11 divisions which alternate running during their Saturday night program: Late Models, Grand Stock, Modifieds, Legends cars, Super Street, UCAR, Pro Six, Super Trucks, HRKC Pro Winged Champ Karts, and Enduros.</p>",

Panorama was originally carved out of the hills around Bathurst in the 1930s. Through a national employment relief effort during The Depression, local and federal government developed what had been a dirt-track/tourist drive into a race track. Mt Panorama's first event was staged on April, 1938 and – apart from the years during World War II – the circuit has been in regular use ever since. Historically, the racetrack has been used for a wide variety of racing categories, including everything from open-wheel racers to motorcycles. In recent years Mt Panorama has been best known as home of the Bathurst 12 Hour sports car race in February and October's Bathurst 1000, a signature event in the V8 Supercar Series.</p>",

      "detail_copy": "<p>Major league auto racing arrived in New England in style when New Hampshire Motor Speedway opened its gates in the summer of 1990. The first superspeedway constructed in the United States in twenty years, NHMS heralded the start of a construction frenzy that would see more than a dozen new speedways built around the country by the close of the decade. Many of the new tracks would be faster, some more ostentatious, but none placed a premium on car and driver like NHMS.</p> <p>Just over a mile in length, NHMS' oval is a classic \"paper-clip\" design with long straightaways and tight, flat turns. Not surprisingly, the track rewards cars that have plenty of \"grunt\" off the corners and brakes capable of getting things slowed-down at the end of the front straightaway and the backstretch... not to mention drivers who can baby those brakes from start to finish in races lasting three hours or more while making their cars work high and low in the turns.</p> <p>Speaking of more, there's more to NHMS than the one mile oval. In keeping with a heritage dating back to 1965 when the site was home to twisty Bryar Motorsports Park, NHMS offers top-flight road racing. Although the configurations incorporate different portions of the oval and twisting infield roads, they all utilize a breathtaking loop that climbs into the countryside beyond the backstretch to a 180 degree bowl of a turn before plunging back down to the oval.</p> <p>With an oval hosting a full slate of NASCAR competition including NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482;, NASCAR Nationwide Series&#8482;, NASCAR Camping World Truck Series&#8482;, Nascar Camping World East Series&#8482; and Nascar Whelen Modifieds Series&#8482;, road courses that are home to a variety of SCCA and vintage sports car events as well as motorcycle races and permanent seating for more than 105,000 spectators, it's no wonder NHMS is the undisputed home of motorsports in New England. Nor was it any wonder when founders Bob and Gary Bahre decided to sell the facility in 2008 that Bruton Smith and Speedway Motorsports Inc. were happy to make them an offer they couldn't refuse.</p> <p>Speaking of more, there's more to NHMS than a one mile oval. The facility features the new 0.25-mile Granite State Legends Cars Mini-Oval and, in keeping with a heritage dating back to 1965 when the site was home to twisty Bryar Motorsports Park, NMHS offers top-flight road racing as well. Although the configurations incorporate different portions of the big oval and twisting infield roads, they all utilize a breathtaking loop that climbs into the countryside beyond the backstretch to a 180 degree bowl of a turn before plunging back down to the oval.</p>",

The roads were later widened to accommodate automobile races and the 1930s ended with two memorable Donington Grands Prix won by Bernd Rosemeyer and Tazio Nuvolari in their Auto Union \"Silver Arrows.\"</p> <p>Donington Park was used as a military vehicle depot during World War II and it wasn't until businessman and car collector Tom Wheatcroft rebuilt the track that motorsports returned to the venue in the 1970s. The \"new\" Donington Park utilized most of the original layout, along with an additional loop featuring the Melbourne and Goddard's hairpins.</p> <p>Donington Park became a fixture on the club and national racing calendars, as well as home to the British Moto GP and hosted a 1993 European Grand Prix that saw Ayrton Senna score perhaps the most brilliant win of his Formula One career.</p> <p>The facility was later leased to Donington Ventures Leisure Ltd which demolished portions of the track in order to upgrade the facility in the hopes of making Donington Park the permanent home of the British Grand Prix.

The roads were later widened to accommodate automobile races and the 1930s ended with two memorable Donington Grands Prix won by Bernd Rosemeyer and Tazio Nuvolari in their Auto Union \"Silver Arrows.\"</p> <p>Donington Park was used as a military vehicle depot during World War II and it wasn't until businessman and car collector Tom Wheatcroft rebuilt the track that motorsports returned to the venue in the 1970s. The \"new\" Donington Park utilized most of the original layout, along with an additional loop featuring the Melbourne and Goddard's hairpins.</p> <p>Donington Park became a fixture on the club and national racing calendars, as well as home to the British Moto GP and hosted a 1993 European Grand Prix that saw Ayrton Senna score perhaps the most brilliant win of his Formula One career.</p> <p>The facility was later leased to Donington Ventures Leisure Ltd which demolished portions of the track in order to upgrade the facility in the hopes of making Donington Park the permanent home of the British Grand Prix. After those plans failed to materialize, the Wheatcroft family regained control of the circuit in 2009. The rebuilt Donington Park now stages a variety of club and national races as well as the British round of the World Touring Championship.</p> <p>In addition to motorsports, Donington Park hosts a variety of events including music festivals and public markets and is home to the Donington Grand Prix Museum, the world's foremost collection of Formula One cars.</p>",

Along with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (constructed in 1909), the Circuit de la Sarthe is one of the oldest active racing facilities, having first hosted the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1923.</p><p>Composed entirely of public roads near the French city of Le Mans, the Circuit de la Sarthe of the 1920s was 10.7 miles (17.2 km) long.  A triangular loop that ran into Le Mans itself was eliminated in 1932 by a bypass that reduced the track to 8.3 miles (13.4 km) in length and formed the basis for the track's modern 8.4 miles (13.6 km) configuration.</p><p>Although the Circuit de la Sarthe still incorporates public roads, the track has been modified over the years in the interests of safety, never moreso than when the pit straightaway was widened following a horrific accident in 1955 that claimed the lives of 83 people.  Subsequently, a purpose-built section of high speed curves (Porsche Curves) and increasingly tight chicanes (Ford Chicanes) was created during the early 1970s to slow cars as they approached the pits.  In 1987 another chicane was added on the approach to the first turn (Dunlop Curve) and, three years later, a pair of medium speed chicanes were added to what was once the 3.7 mile long Mulsanne Straightaway.</p><p>Evolutionary changes notwithstanding, the essential nature Circuit de la Sarthe remains unchanged: it is a supreme test of race cars and race drivers, with long straights where low drag is paramount, the superfast Porsche Curves which place a premium on downforce, highly technical, twisty chicanes and tight corners at the end of high speed sections to test a car's brakes . . . and a driver's ability to use them.</p><p>In its glorious history, the Circuit de la Sarthe has witnessed countless epic battles among legendary drivers with names like Nuvolari, Fangio, Moss, Gendebien, Hill, Amon, McLaren, Gurney, Foyt, Pescarolo, Ickx, Bell, McNish and Kristensen and the world's leading automakers from the Bentleys of the 1920s to the streamlined Bugattis and Alfa Romeos of the '30s.  Following World War II, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Aston Martin and Ferrari waged titanic battles at Le Mans, before the epic Ford v Ferrari showdowns of the mid-'60s and the Porsche v Ferrari classics of the '70s featuring the fearsomely iconic Porsche 917s and Ferrari 512s.</p><p>After Porsche emerged as the dominant marque in the '80s and '90s, Audi ruled the Circuit de la Sarthe (first with its turbocharged V8 Audi R8 and, later, turbo diesel R10 TDI) for the first decade of the 21st century (notwithstanding Peugeot's win in '09).  Of late, Le Mans has seen fantastically complex hybrid prototypes from Audi, Porsche and Toyota battle for the overall win while other marques including Aston Martin, Chevrolet (Corvette), Ferrari, Porsche, BMW and Ford have battled for GT honors around a circuit whose landmarks like the Dunlop Bridge and the Tertre Rouge, Mulsanne, Indianapolis and Arnage turns stir the souls of motor racing fans around the world. Home of the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Circuit de la Sarthe is hallowed ground in the world of motor racing.  Along with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (constructed in 1909), the Circuit de la Sarthe is one of the oldest active racing facilities, having first hosted the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1923.</p>",

Along with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (constructed in 1909), the Circuit de la Sarthe is one of the oldest active racing facilities, having first hosted the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1923.</p><p>Composed entirely of public roads near the French city of Le Mans, the Circuit de la Sarthe of the 1920s was 10.7 miles (17.2 km) long.  A triangular loop that ran into Le Mans itself was eliminated in 1932 by a bypass that reduced the track to 8.3 miles (13.4 km) in length and formed the basis for the track's modern 8.4 miles (13.6 km) configuration.</p><p>Although the Circuit de la Sarthe still incorporates public roads, the track has been modified over the years in the interests of safety, never moreso than when the pit straightaway was widened following a horrific accident in 1955 that claimed the lives of 83 people.  Subsequently, a purpose-built section of high speed curves (Porsche Curves) and increasingly tight chicanes (Ford Chicanes) was created during the early 1970s to slow cars as they approached the pits.  In 1987 another chicane was added on the approach to the first turn (Dunlop Curve) and, three years later, a pair of medium speed chicanes were added to what was once the 3.7 mile long Mulsanne Straightaway.</p><p>Evolutionary changes notwithstanding, the essential nature Circuit de la Sarthe remains unchanged: it is a supreme test of race cars and race drivers, with long straights where low drag is paramount, the superfast Porsche Curves which place a premium on downforce, highly technical, twisty chicanes and tight corners at the end of high speed sections to test a car's brakes . . . and a driver's ability to use them.</p><p>In its glorious history, the Circuit de la Sarthe has witnessed countless epic battles among legendary drivers with names like Nuvolari, Fangio, Moss, Gendebien, Hill, Amon, McLaren, Gurney, Foyt, Pescarolo, Ickx, Bell, McNish and Kristensen and the world's leading automakers from the Bentleys of the 1920s to the streamlined Bugattis and Alfa Romeos of the '30s.  Following World War II, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Aston Martin and Ferrari waged titanic battles at Le Mans, before the epic Ford v Ferrari showdowns of the mid-'60s and the Porsche v Ferrari classics of the '70s featuring the fearsomely iconic Porsche 917s and Ferrari 512s.</p><p>After Porsche emerged as the dominant marque in the '80s and '90s, Audi ruled the Circuit de la Sarthe (first with its turbocharged V8 Audi R8 and, later, turbo diesel R10 TDI) for the first decade of the 21st century (notwithstanding Peugeot's win in '09).  Of late, Le Mans has seen fantastically complex hybrid prototypes from Audi, Porsche and Toyota battle for the overall win while other marques including Aston Martin, Chevrolet (Corvette), Ferrari, Porsche, BMW and Ford have battled for GT honors around a circuit whose landmarks like the Dunlop Bridge and the Tertre Rouge, Mulsanne, Indianapolis and Arnage turns stir the souls of motor racing fans around the world. Home of the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Circuit de la Sarthe is hallowed ground in the world of motor racing.

Michigan's width and steep banking ensure there's always more than one racing groove, and the fact that MIS is a non-restrictor-plate track means drivers have more than enough power to make a challenge out of the turns at both ends of the track.\r\n<br> <br>\r\nOnce upon a time Indy cars frolicked on those high banks at breathtaking speeds, witness Paul Tracy's record qualifying lap of 234.949 mph. Today, Michigan regularly vies with Daytona, Talladega and Texas as NASCAR's fastest speedway, with Ryan Newman holding the NASCAR Cup Series track record of 194.232 mph. While MIS' Stirling Moss-designed 3.1-mile road course and the Can-Am and Trans-Am races of days gone-by are now just fond memories, the track has a 1.9-mile interior road course that has challenged IMSA and amateur racers down through the years.\r\n<br> <br>\r\nIt's no wonder some of stock car racing's most legendary drivers have thrived on the banks of MIS since Cale Yarborough defeated Lee Roy Yarbrough in the inaugural NASCAR race there in 1969. Richard Petty and David Pearson, Bobby and Davey Allison, Dale Earnhardt Senior and Junior, Jeff Gordon and Jimmie Johnson have all since added their names to the roll call of MIS winners, one that also includes names like Mario Andretti, A.J. Foyt, Al Unser, Rick Mears and Alex Zanardi from the days when Indy cars raced in the Irish Hills, not to mention Parnelli Jones and Mark Donohue, Trans-Am winners on the MIS road course that, once upon a time, snaked through the countryside behind the backstretch. Allison to Yarborough, Andretti to Zanardi, the world's greatest race drivers have been coming to Michigan International Speedway to test their mettle for more than 40 years. And the fans have followed by the hundreds of thousands.\r\n<br> <br>\r\nDetroit-area real-estate developer Larry LoPatin had the vision to build first Michigan International Speedway and then a Southwestern duplicate, Texas World Speedway in College Station, TX. But LoPatin's reach exceeded his grasp and it was a fellow named Roger Penske who stepped in and turned MIS into an auto-racing showcase. Under Penske's direction, MIS grew from a rather modest seating capacity of 25,000 to more than 125,000 between 1972 and '99. And the first order of business when the International Speedway Corporation acquired the facility from Penske? Add another 10,000 seats in Turn Three, enhancing MIS' status as the largest sports facility in the Wolverine State.",

Situated in the Pocono Mountains of northeastern Pennsylvania , the 2.5 mile tri-oval features three very different turns connected by straightaways of varying length. Turn One is banked at 14 degrees, Turn Two (aka the \"Tunnel Turn\") is banked at eight degrees and Turn Three at six degrees. Pocono's main straightaway is the longest on any North American speedway at 3,740 feet, the \"Long Pond\" straightaway stretches for 3,055 feet between Turns One and Two, while the run from Turn Two to Turn Three is a mere 1,780 feet.</p> <p>The resulting speedway poses special demands on drivers and engineer alike, for a chassis that works well on the steeply-banked Turn One will be less than ideal for the flatter Turn Two, let alone Turn Three, and the downforce necessary for maximum grip in any of the turns will slow a car on the two long straightaways. And Turn Three requires heavy braking - in some cases even a gearchange - making Pocono Raceway among the world's most challenging speedways.</p> <p>Pocono Raceway first opened for business in 1969 featuring a three quarter mile oval. The 2.5 mile speedway was completed in 1971 and immediately began hosting one of the jewels in Indy car racing triple crown of 500 mile races. Local hero Mario Andretti battled the likes of A.J.

Still, the best seat in the house is the one behind the wheel. But it's sure not a relaxing one, with laps at racing speeds ticking by at barely more than 15 seconds. Oh, and the compact nature of the track means that there are infield pits on both the front and rear straightaways, so drivers have that added complication to deal with.

Next, the road plunges downhill then climbs abruptly to Druids Bend before diving down through Graham Hill Bend to Cooper Straight . . . and that's just the first half mile.</p> <p>Brands Hatch hosted its first major international race in 1960, when Jack Brabham won the non-championship Silver City Trophy Formula One race, and was selected as the site of the British Grand Prix four years later. Subsequently, Brands Hatch alternated with Silverstone as the home of the British Grand Prix, producing many noteworthy winners from Jim Clark to Niki Lauda and Alan Jones.</p> <p>Although safety concerns saw the British GP move to Silverstone in 1987, Brands Hatch continues to host leading international and national events including the World and British Touring Car Championships, the FIA Formula Two and British Formula Three championships and the British Superbike Championship as well the Formula Ford Festival which has served as a springboard for the likes of Derek Daly, Mark Webber and Jenson Button.</p> <p>Brands Hatch has also hosted Indy car races on two occasions, indeed the 1.2 mile club track's official name is the Indy circuit. Rick Mears won a USAC-sanctioned race there in 1978 while Sebastien Bourdais claimed the first of his 31 Champ Car wins on the Indy circuit 25 years later.</p>",

Sonoma Raceway presents a unique challenge for drivers of big stock cars. While the 1.99-mile, 10-turn stock car configuration cuts off two slow turns and a half mile of pavement, there are still plenty of ups and downs and zigs and zags for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; and NASCAR Camping World West Series&#8482; drivers to cope with.

This layout, opened in 2003, skips much of the Esses and run from Turn 10 to Turn 11 (the hairpin) for additional safety for motorcyclists, including runoff available in the motorcycle Turn 11 (the main Turn 11 has no runoff, and is a very slow turn, similar to the Loews hairpin at Monaco).</p> <p>Until it was taken over by Speedway Motorsports in 1996, the facility endured a turbulent history under a variety or names and owners (one of which was a Hollywood studio!) While the circuit opened for competition in 1968 under the name Sears Point Raceway and hosted , USAC Indy car, NASCAR West stock car, SCCA professional and amateur and AMA motorcycle races, it failed to perform financially and was closed down two years later. In 1973 the track reopened as a venue for amateur sports car competition and - on a separate drag strip - drag racing, but it wasn't until 1989 and the arrival of NASCAR's top series that the track's prospects truly began to brighten. A $60 million improvement program, begun in 2000, has catapulted Sonoma Raceway into the top rank of American motorsport facilities.</p>",

Just a year after the first race the 1.5-mile the oval track was in bankruptcy, done in by a huge infield rock formation that ballooned construction costs far beyond what its two founders had forecast.</p><p>Almost 60 years later nearly everything is different. More than 89,000 seats ring the race track, which was the first superspeedway to install lights for night racing; the first race track to incorporate a condominium apartment complex overlooking the racing surface; the first to build an office complex with the same view; the first race track to sell naming rights; and the first to open a year-round club where members can spectate during races and socialize with fellow club members at other times. Everything is very different from 1960 except for one thing: Charlotte Motor Speedway is still owned by Bruton Smith.</p><p>These days Charlotte Motor Speedway is the queen of a publicly-traded motorsports empire controlled by Smith. With the legendary H.A. “Humpy” Wheeler managing the day-to-day operations and promoting the races with flair and imagination, the track was soon among the most successful in the world.</p><p>The Charlotte Motor Speedway built a new infield road course, designed specifically for NASCAR competition, in 2018. It utilizes nearly all of the 1.5 mile oval as well as newly built infield portion – thus the name Roval (Road/Oval).</p><p>The Roval configuration is a 17-turn, 2.28 mile track that challenges the best of drivers and team. Car setups are typically compromises – a car good on the oval may not be so good in the infield and vice versa so drivers and crew chiefs have to decide what matters most to them. Two chicanes, one on the back straight and one just before the start finish line, make for some exciting passing opportunities as competitors can attempt to out brake each other.</p>",

      "detail_copy": "<p>Opened in 1960 by Bruton Smith and NASCAR driving legend Curtis Turner with the running of the longest stock car race in history, the World 600, the Charlotte Motor Speedway closed before it would ultimately become the home track of so many NASCAR team. Just a year after the first race the 1.5-mile the oval track was in bankruptcy, done in by a huge infield rock formation that ballooned construction costs far beyond what its two founders had forecast.</p><p>Almost 60 years later nearly everything is different. More than 89,000 seats ring the race track, which was the first superspeedway to install lights for night racing; the first race track to incorporate a condominium apartment complex overlooking the racing surface; the first to build an office complex with the same view; the first race track to sell naming rights; and the first to open a year-round club where members can spectate during races and socialize with fellow club members at other times. Everything is very different from 1960 except for one thing: Charlotte Motor Speedway is still owned by Bruton Smith.</p><p>These days Charlotte Motor Speedway is the queen of a publicly-traded motorsports empire controlled by Smith. With the legendary H.A. “Humpy” Wheeler managing the day-to-day operations and promoting the races with flair and imagination, the track was soon among the most successful in the world.</p><p>The Charlotte Motor Speedway built a new infield road course, designed specifically for NASCAR competition, in 2018. It utilizes nearly all of the 1.5 mile oval as well as newly built infield portion – thus the name Roval (Road/Oval).</p><p>The Roval configuration is a 17-turn, 2.28 mile track that challenges the best of drivers and team. Car setups are typically compromises – a car good on the oval may not be so good in the infield and vice versa so drivers and crew chiefs have to decide what matters most to them. Two chicanes, one on the back straight and one just before the start finish line, make for some exciting passing opportunities as competitors can attempt to out brake each other.</p>",

The 1.5-mile oval of Texas Motor Speedway is home to everything from NASCAR's top three classes and the open-wheelers of the IndyCar Series to Legends Cars.</p> <p>Located on the north side of Fort Worth, the construction of Texas Motor Speedway began in spring of 1995 and required the movement of more than four million cubic yards of earth before it was completed the following year. The oval originally featured unique dual-angle banking and its first major race, a NASCAR Nationwide Series&#8482; event in April, 1997, was won by Mark Martin. Jeff Burton captured the first NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; race the following day, in front of a sell-out crowd of over 200,000. Two months later, Kenny Irwin won the first NASCAR Camping World Truck Series&#8482; race held at TMS. The track has been good to Dale Earnhardt, Jr.; he won his first ever NASCAR Nationwide Series&#8482; race there in 1998, and then two years later, won his first NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; race. Shortly after Earnhardt's NASCAR Nationwide Series&#8482; win, the oval was reconfigured, eliminating the eight-degree section of the dual-angle banking.</p> <p>While the Indy Racing League's IndyCars have developed a reputation for close and sometimes spectacular racing at Texas Motor Speedway over the past decade, in 2001 CART's Champ Cars single visit to the speedway demonstrated that cars can sometimes be just too fast for a venue. Kenny Brack won the pole at a sizzling 233  mph, but before the green flag could wave the following day, the race was cancelled when all but two of the drivers experienced disorientation or dizziness due to sustained g-loading on the banking.</p> <p>Though not currently scheduling professional road racing, Texas Motor Speedway has previously been host to the American Le Mans Series and the Star Mazda Championship. An upcoming addition to the Texas Motor Speedway is the Texas Motorsports Hall of Fame, which celebrates the state's rich auto racing heritage.</p> <p>iRacing's virtual version of TMS includes a total of six configurations, from the big 24-degree-banked quad oval to the pit-lane-and-front-stretch short oval that plays host to Legends Car races; plus a total of four road-course layouts - the 2.28-mile primary circuit that includes most of the big oval, and three smaller infield-only courses.</p>",

In the wake of Hurricane Andrew in August, 1992, South Florida racing promoter Ralph Sanchez began organizing construction of the region's first major-league motorsports facility as part of the reconstruction of the devastated Homestead community. Ground-breaking took place the following August and in November, 2005, the first event, a NASCAR Nationwide Series&#8482; race, was won by Dale Jarrett.</p> <p>Host to the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; season-finale, as well as NASCAR Nationwide Series&#8482; and NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series&#8482;; The 1.5-mile variable-banked Homestead-Miami oval is also the site of the season-opening Indy Racing League series event. Rounds of the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series&#8482; and Grand-Am KONI Challenge Series&#8482; take place on the IRL weekend, with a quick conversion to one of the two road-circuit configurations. SCCA amateur races and CSS motorcycle races also take place on the road circuit.</p> <p>With more than a thousand palm trees and a Caribbean color scheme, the facility projects a South Beach flavor that distinguishes Homestead-Miami from other major race tracks in America. It took a while longer to get the right combination for the racing surface. In its first iteration, the track had four separate low-banked corners, reminiscent of a mini Indianapolis Motor Speedway. That configuration failed to promote good racing, and unfortunately also provided bad crash angles. Widening the aprons failed to correct either of these problems.</p> <p>A major reconfiguration of the track during the summer of 1997 brought a more conventional layout - sweeping 180-degree corners at either end of the oval. Close, but still no cigar. But the most recent work on the track, during which the track assumed variable banking - up to 20 degrees in the corners, flattening to 3 degrees on the straightaways - has done the trick. Everyone agrees, at Homestead-Miami, the beauty is now more than skin deep.</p>",

      "detail_copy": "<p>Bristol Motor Speedway bills itself as the \"World's Fastest Half-Mile\", and despite straightaways barely 200 yards long, it is a very fast racetrack. The secret is in the variable banking in the 300-yard wide-open corners - you may not have much room to accelerate off one corner before shutting down for the next, but with steep banking (up to 30 degrees) there's not much loss of speed when you get there. And the all-concrete racing surface provides great traction.</p><p>\nWith 160,000 seats, arrayed in grandstands all the way around the racing surface, Bristol looks more like a football stadium on steroids than a typical race track. Veteran drivers have described racing at this East Tennessee speed emporium as the equivalent of \"flying a fighter plane in a gymnasium,\" so it's not surprising that every NASCAR Cup Series race draws a massive crowd. Still, the best seat in the house is the one behind the wheel. But it's sure not a relaxing one, with laps at racing speeds ticking by at barely more than 15 seconds. Oh, and the compact nature of the track means that there are infield pits on both the front and rear straightaways, so drivers have that added complication to deal with. At the conclusion of a 500-lap NASCAR Cup Series race, not a single car makes it back to the garage without at least a few bumps, scrapes or other battle bruises. And the drivers aren't in much better shape.</p><p>\nOpened for competition in 1961, Bristol Motor Speedway has had a number of remodels over the years, and several owners as well. It has been under its current owner, Speedway Motorsports, that Bristol Motor Speedway has enjoyed its greatest period of growth. The track hosts events for all three of NASCAR’s national series and the ARCA Menards Series, and as of 2021, once again goes through a dirt makeover in the spring to welcome World of Outlaws events as well as the Cup Series’ only dirt race.</p>",

As a replacement for the old beach road course a few miles east, the opening of the high-banked, 2.5-mile Florida tri-oval represented the leading edge of a wave of construction of big, paved speed palaces. Before Daytona, Indianapolis was the only American oval track longer than 1.25 miles, and most racing took place on dirt ovals a mile or less in length. From the very first Daytona 500, won by Lee Petty in a three-way photo finish, those high banks, so steep that it is hard to walk up them, proved a favorable venue for wide-open stock car racing, and Daytona kicked off the growth of NASCAR as we know it today.</p> <p>Daytona was also the first multi-use facility, with a 3.56-mile road circuit incorporating the infield and most of the oval. Host not only to the Daytona 500, but also to the Rolex 24 season kick-off for the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series&#8482;, the AMA's signature Daytona 200 during Bike Week, the WKA's Daytona KartWeek between Christmas and New Years and a host of driving-school, club and other events, Daytona's busy and diverse schedule confirms the track's motto, \"The World Center of Racing.\"</p> <p>Save for the racing surface itself, Daytona International Speedway's infrastructure has grown and changed to such a degree that it would be almost unrecognizable today to someone who hasn't seen it over the last 20 years. It is an amazing motorsport facility. But one thing hasn't changed over the past six decades: No driver can consider his or her career complete without notching a victory at Daytona. From Dale Earnhardt, who captured the Daytona 500 in 1998 after coming close so many times, to 14-year-old kart racers whose racing resumes are just beginning, a victory at Daytona is a mark of distinction.</p> <p>Resurfaced and rescanned in 2011, the daunting challenge of Daytona can now be experienced during day or night!</p>",

Fans and competitors couldn't have dreamed they'd have it so good. While Ascot was a gritty dirt track that harkened back to the oldest traditions of short-track racing, Irwindale is clean, modern and filled with amenities for drivers, crews, fans and sponsors.</p> <p>The facility features banked, paved half-mile and third- mile oval tracks, and a state-of-the-art MUSCO lighting system that makes racing at night just like racing during the day. A Bose sound system ensures that everyone in the 15,000-seat grandstand can hear the announcer over the roar of the racing engines.</p> <p>NASCAR Late Model Stock Car Series&#8482; and Legends Cars are among the large number of classes that compete regularly at Irwindale. (Others include , USAC Midgets and Sprint Cars, Supermodifieds, Super Late Models, Trucks, Mini Stocks. To say nothing of drawing big crowds for drifting events and serving as the site for the world-record setting run by a radio-control car - 111 mph!)</p> <p>While Angelenos call it their home-town short track, Irwindale draws national attention for two of its annual special events. As the inheritor of short-track racing tradition in Southern California, Irwindale hosts the legendary Turkey Night Grand Prix, a series of Thanksgiving weekend races for Midgets and Sprint Cars that goes back to the 1950s. And since 2003, the half-mile mile oval has hosted the NASCAR Toyota All-Star Showdown&#8482;.</p>",

Sonoma Raceway presents a unique challenge for drivers of big stock cars. While the 1.99-mile, 10-turn stock car configuration cuts off two slow turns and a half mile of pavement, there are still plenty of ups and downs and zigs and zags for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series&#8482; and NASCAR Camping World West Series&#8482; drivers to cope with. Keeping the tires and brakes in good working order while maintaining a competitive pace is one of the bigger challenges these drivers face all year.</p> <p>Most other road-racing classes that compete at Sonoma, including the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series&#8482;, SCCA National and Regional, NASA and vintage use the full 2.52-mile, 12-turn circuit, while the IRL Indy cars and AMA motorcycle events use a modified 2.22 mile (3.57 km), 12 turn course. This layout, opened in 2003, skips much of the Esses and run from Turn 10 to Turn 11 (the hairpin) for additional safety for motorcyclists, including runoff available in the motorcycle Turn 11 (the main Turn 11 has no runoff, and is a very slow turn, similar to the Loews hairpin at Monaco).</p> <p>Until it was taken over by Speedway Motorsports in 1996, the facility endured a turbulent history under a variety or names and owners (one of which was a Hollywood studio!) While the circuit opened for competition in 1968 under the name Sears Point Raceway and hosted , USAC Indy car, NASCAR West stock car, SCCA professional and amateur and AMA motorcycle races, it failed to perform financially and was closed down two years later. In 1973 the track reopened as a venue for amateur sports car competition and - on a separate drag strip - drag racing, but it wasn't until 1989 and the arrival of NASCAR's top series that the track's prospects truly began to brighten. A $60 million improvement program, begun in 2000, has catapulted Sonoma Raceway into the top rank of American motorsport facilities.</p>",

Knockhill features nine corners and over 120 feet of elevation changes on its main layout, with lengthy straightaways both leading into and out of the final corner, known as Taylor's hairpin.

The track was designed and tested by iRacing in cooperation with NASCAR in advance of the unique event, with top real-world and sim racing pros all logging countless laps before both its release on iRacing and real-world debut. The change in venue also leads to a change in format, with qualifying heats to build the feature grid in a manner similar to a local short track race.</p> <p>Now's your chance to take the wheel in a unique part of NASCAR history in one of America's most iconic sporting venues.
