Fixes / Changes:

- Season Driver Standings Deserialization Failure (Issue #224)
    Fixed an issue where the "SeasonDriverStandings" deserialization would fail
    due to the "avg_start_position" property containing non-integer data.

- Support "Legacy Authentication" Setting Failure Response (Issue #223)
    Added support for the "Legacy Authentication" setting in the iRacing
    account settings. This setting will be required to login to the
    "/data API" after iRacing enables multi-factor authentication (aka "2FA").

    If the setting is not enabled, an "iRacingLoginFailedException" will be
    thrown when attempting to login with the new "LegacyAuthenticationRequired"
    property set to "true" and the following message:

    Access was denied with message \"legacy authorization refused"
