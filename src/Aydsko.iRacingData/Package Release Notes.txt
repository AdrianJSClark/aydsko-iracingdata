Fixes / Changes:

 - Fields that are durations (e.g. lap times or intervals) will use the "TimeSpan" data type
 - Fields that are instants (e.g. session start time) will use the "DateTimeOffset" data type
 - Added "RaceWeekNumber" properties which calculate the actual race week based on the zero-based "RaceWeekIndex"
