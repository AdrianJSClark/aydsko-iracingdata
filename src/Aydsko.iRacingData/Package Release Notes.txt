NOTE:
iRacing has enabled two-factor authentication by default. To continue to use this library you must enable "Legacy Authentication" in your iRacing account settings before attempting to authenticate. Please do not enable this setting unless you require it, as it may reduce the security on your iRacing account.

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Removed .NET 6 support as it is now unsupported by Microsoft. (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core)
