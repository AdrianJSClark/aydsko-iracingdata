New Versioning Scheme:

Ideally you should always use the latest version of the library that is available. This is because iRacing will sometimes introduce API changes during a release which make the old code incompatible.

This library will use version numbers will be in the format:

    [YY][SS].[R]

Where:
 - YY = two digit year
 - SS = the iRacing season the library release was made in as a zero-padded number (i.e. 01, 02, 03, 04)
 - R  = release number, which increments when changes are made although it may not be sequential

Example:

 - 2303.1 = changes compatible with iRacing 2023 Season 3 or later, and is release 1 during this season
