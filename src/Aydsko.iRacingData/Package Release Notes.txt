Fixes / Changes:

 - Fixed parameter handling error which omitted some values from a Series Result Search request.
 - Support 2023 Season 3 Changes (Issue: #178)
 - Move track screen shot URI generation on to "IDataClient" so it is more discoverable. (Issue: #177)
 - Handle the security based changes from 2023 Season 3 Patch 1.



New Versioning Scheme:

From now on the version numbers will be in the format:

    [YY][SS].[R]

Where:
 - YY = two digit year
 - SS = the iRacing season this corresponds to as a zero-padded number (i.e. 01, 02, 03, 04)
 - R  = release number, which increments when changes are made although it may not be sequential

Example:

 - 2303.1 = changes compatible with iRacing 2023 Season 3, release 1
