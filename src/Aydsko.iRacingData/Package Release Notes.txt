Fixes / Changes:

 - Made the new login from iRacing's 2022 Season 3 the default. The "Use2022Season3Login" flag is not obsolete and will be removed in the next release.

 - Used "TimeSpan" for duration data on "Results.DriverResult" instead of raw numbers.

 - Implemented new endpoints:
    - "Categories" and "Event Types" constants
    - "Series"
    - "Series Assets"
    - "Hosted/League Session" search
    - "Official Session" search
    - "Member Chart Data"
    - "League Directory Search"

 - Support for new "Track Assets" fields which return map layers.
