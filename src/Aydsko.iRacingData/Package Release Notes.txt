BREAKING CHANGES:

iRacing has enabled two-factor authentication by default. To continue to use this library you **must** [enable "Legacy Authentication" in your iRacing account settings](https://support.iracing.com/support/solutions/articles/31000173894-enabling-or-disabling-legacy-read-only-authentication) before attempting to authenticate. Please **do not** enable this setting unless you require it, as it may reduce the security on your iRacing account.

Fixes / Changes:

- Correctly handle the "Legacy authorization refused." login error message.
